To Do:
Head - [needs to output b and eta.]

Time embedding
Message passing (optional)
Adapt to property(if there)
Linear layer - to project the noded to required shape of b and eta (Both b and eta needs to be of shape of Xt)

Decoder:
Nequip - cutoff after interaction blocks (message passing). self-interaction layer and tensor operations are need to be defined to get outputs of required shape(that will be done in the head
