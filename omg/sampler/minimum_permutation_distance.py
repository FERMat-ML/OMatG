    For every configuration in the batch, permute the fractional coordinates (and species) in x_0 so that it minimizes
    the distance with respect to the corresponding configuration in x_1.

    This function modifies x_0 in place.

    Switching both the species and the fractional coordinations will keep the original configuration intact and just
    change the order of atoms. This order is relevant for the pairings in the stochastic interpolants during training.

    However, in crystal-structure prediction, the species should not be permuted so that stochastic interpolants are
    constructed between the same species.

    In de-novo generation, we either use fully masked species or uniformly distributed species, so that keeping the
    species or not does not yield any difference.
